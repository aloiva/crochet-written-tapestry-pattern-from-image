# What is this
previous name: crochet-written-tapestry-pattern-from-image

written patterns for tapestries exist but all the good ones like stitch fiddle are paid. i prefer written over colour printed patterns so here is an effort to create them with minimal effort.
currently only supports certain formats (c2c isnt there sadly but maybe soon).

the program takes a screenshot of a tapestry image, and gives a written pattern for it.


# How to use
- install using the .exe in releases (works only for windows as expected)
- upload only clean screenshots from patterns taken from stitch fiddle or stitchboard (pattern creation and image/pdf download is free). make sure that the image looks in this format:
  
  <img src="https://github.com/aloiva/pattern-fiddle/assets/68387945/e3883ae1-1a01-4972-8c8f-04abb673cf5f" width=20% height=20%>
- remember the number of rows and columns in the tapestry
- make sure to give unique names to all the colours included
- output pattern supports four formats. all will be present in the final .txt file that opens up.
